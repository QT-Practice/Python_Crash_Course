# A method is an action that Python can perform on a piece of data. 
# The dot (.) after name in name.title() tells Python to make the title() method act on the variable name. 
# Every method is followed by a set of parentheses, because methods often need additional information to do their work. 
# That information is provided inside the parentheses. 
# The title() function doesnâ€™t need any additional information, so its parentheses are empty.
# Unless the edited value is saved as a new variable, the edited value is temporary and is not saved. 

name = "ada lovelace"
print (name.title())
print (name.upper())
print (name.lower())
print(name)
